# Getting Started

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js version 18 or higher.
- Terminal for accessing Laman.js via its command line interface (CLI).
- Text Editor with HTML syntax support.
  - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended, along with the official [Edge.js extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AdonisJS.vscode-edge).

Laman.js ships with a command line setup that will help you scaffold a basic project. You can install it with:

```bash
npm init lamanjs my-web
```

After installation, start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## File Structure

Assuming you chose to scaffold the Laman.js project in `./my-web`, the generated file structure should look like this:

```
my-web
└───public
└───src
│   └───pages
│   │   └───index.edge
└───package.json
```
