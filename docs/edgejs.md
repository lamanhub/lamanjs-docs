# Edge.js

Laman.js utilizes `Edge.js`, a modern and user-friendly template engine for Node.js, to simplify the creation of dynamic web applications. Edge.js is designed to feel natural for developers familiar with JavaScript, providing a straightforward and powerful way to manage templates without the need to learn a new language or syntax.

`Edge.js` is a backend template engine that integrates seamlessly with Laman.js’s server-side rendering (SSR) features. It’s flexible, allowing developers to write JavaScript expressions directly within their templates, and supports features like conditionals, loops, async/await, and reusable components.

For more detailed information on Edge.js, including its features and syntax, you can refer to the official [Edge.js documentation](https://edgejs.dev).
